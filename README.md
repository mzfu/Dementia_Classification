# Dementia_Classification
Dementia ascertainment algorithms in existing, representative population-level samples are still immature. We developed multiple machine learning-based algorithms for dementia ascertainment in a public longitudinal panel cohort study, the Health and Retirement Study, and compared performances to traditional summary score cutoff-based Langa-Kabeto-Weir algorithm and the Expert model derived from experienced epidemiologists. Using the self-respondent sample (N_patient = 614, N_obs = 1,442), our top-three machine learning-based algorithms all outperformed the traditional ones, with overall accuracy scores of over 70%. The abilities of those algorithms to differentiate dementia cases from normal cognition cases were relatively high. However, the performance of separating the transitioning stage, cognitive impairment non-dementia, from other classes (normal cognition especially) was not ideal. Out algorithms could be beneficial to future dementia-related research because they help increase the robustness and soundness of observational findings, and offer a cost-effective alternative approach to expand the research to a larger scope at the same time.
